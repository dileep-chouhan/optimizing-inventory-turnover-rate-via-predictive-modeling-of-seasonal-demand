# Optimizing Inventory Turnover Rate via Predictive Modeling of Seasonal Demand

## Overview

This project aims to optimize inventory turnover rate and reduce warehousing costs by accurately predicting seasonal demand fluctuations.  The analysis leverages historical sales data to build a predictive model capable of forecasting future demand.  The goal is to achieve a 15% reduction in warehousing costs and stockouts within six months of model implementation by minimizing overstocking and preventing stockouts.  The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

To run this project, please ensure you have Python 3 installed.  First, install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, navigate to the project's root directory and run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files, including:

* `sales_trend.png`: A plot visualizing historical sales trends and the model's predictions.  This allows for a visual comparison of actual vs. predicted sales.


Further details on the methodology and specific models employed can be found within the Jupyter Notebook files included in the project.  The `report.pdf` (or similar) file contains a more comprehensive report of the findings and conclusions.
